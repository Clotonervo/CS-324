*** YOU CAN TAKE IN ONE SHEET OF NOTES ***


Environment
  - setting environment for program execution
  - retrieving environment (e.g., from within C)

File descriptors
  - stdin, stdout, stderr
  - redirection / duplication within a program
  - pipe concepts
  - dup2() concepts

Shell usage
  - file descriptor redirection / duplication
  - shell pipelines
  - jobs / job control
    - background / foreground / suspend
  - basic usage of echo, cat, grep

Processes
  - fork
    - concurrency, concurrent execution
    - synchronization with wait() / waitpid()
  - exec
  - orphaned processes ("daemons")
  - zombies/reaping
  - process groups, setpgid(), how a shell handles groups with signals, etc.
  - retrieving status from exited child processes with macros: WIFEXITED/WIFSTOPPED/WIFSIGNALED/etc.

Exceptions
  - asynchronous vs. synchronous
  - traps, faults, aborts
  - system calls

Signals
    - Signal blocking
      > You can't block a SIGKILL or a SIGSTOP signal
    - Sending vs. receiving a signal
    - SIGCHLD, SIGINT, SIGTSTP, SIGCONT, SIGTERM, SIGKILL
    - Default actions, overriding with handlers or with SIG_DFL (default) or SIG_IGN (ignore).
    - Signal blocking with sigprocmask()
    
Virtual Memory
  - Virtual addressing and pages
  - Page table / Page table entries (PTE)
  - Identifying VPN and VPO given a VA
  - Identifying PPN and PPO given a VA and a PTE
  - Identifying a PA given a PPN and PPO
  - TLB - access using TLB index, TLB tag
  - Find a byte of data given a virtual address
