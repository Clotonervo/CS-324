*** YOU CAN TAKE IN ONE SHEET OF NOTES ***


Environment
  - setting environment for program execution
  - retrieving environment (e.g., from within C)

File descriptors
  - stdin, stdout, stderr
  - redirection / duplication within a program
    > /bin/cat file.txt 2 >  &1
      * Redirect stderr(2) to stdout(1)
  - pipe concepts
    > Takes stdout of the first program and puts it into stdin of next program
      * ./program1 | ./program2
  - dup2() concepts
    > dup2(2, 1)
      * Takes the stdout(1) and pushes it into stderr(2)

Shell usage
  - file descriptor redirection / duplication
  - shell pipelines
  - jobs / job control
    - background / foreground / suspend
    > Every Job has a process, but not every process is a job
  - basic usage of echo, cat, grep
    > Grep: ./program | grep [STRING]
      * Ex. ./program | grep bob  => gives you all lines that contains "bob" in them (-v is everything but)

Processes
  - fork
      > if ((pid = fork()) == 0){
              printf("a");
            }
        printf("b");

        // Child will print both "a" and "b", but parent will only print "b"

    - concurrency, concurrent execution
    - synchronization with wait() / waitpid()
  - exec
    > Replaces current process execution with the parameters given
  - orphaned processes ("daemons")
    > Process thats always running in the background
    > Its important that it cleans up its children, because if it doesn't then it will take up a whole lot of resources
    > Zombie children wont be reaped unless explicitly 
  - zombies/reaping
  - process groups, setpgid(), how a shell handles groups with signals, etc.
  - retrieving status from exited child processes with macros: WIFEXITED/WIFSTOPPED/WIFSIGNALED/etc.

Exceptions
  - asynchronous vs. synchronous
  - traps, faults, aborts
  - system calls

Signals
    - Signal blocking
      > You can't block a SIGKILL or a SIGSTOP signal
      > LOOK AT SHELL LAB FOR MAKING A MASK
    - Sending vs. receiving a signal
    - SIGCHLD, SIGINT, SIGTSTP, SIGCONT, SIGTERM, SIGKILL
    - Default actions, overriding with handlers or with SIG_DFL (default) or SIG_IGN (ignore).
    - Signal blocking with sigprocmask()

Virtual Memory
  - Virtual addressing and pages
  - Page table / Page table entries (PTE)
  - Identifying VPN and VPO given a VA
  - Identifying PPN and PPO given a VA and a PTE
  - Identifying a PA given a PPN and PPO
  - TLB - access using TLB index, TLB tag
    > TLB Hit when it is in the table AND valid
  - Find a byte of data given a virtual address
